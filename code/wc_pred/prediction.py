    # The power attribute tries to predict how likely is a team to win 
    # their matches, using as input only their name. 
    #
    # Add the power estimated for each team. The power calculations have 
    # been done within leagues. Since teams only face their league 
    # opponents, it would be difficult to assert if team A from league Z 
    # is better than tieam B from league W. We use game_summaries dataset 
    # to create the inputs for the power model because it contains all 
    # the matches played in the seasons selected.
    #
    # The power algorithm follows these steps for each league:
    # 1. Generate a matrix with rows representing games and columns 
    #    representing teams.
    # 2. For each element of the matrix, if the team 'i' participated 
    #    match 'j', the element [j,i] of the matrix should be filled 
    #    with a one. The value is zero otherwise. Here, teams the 
    #    attributes and games are the observations. 
    # 3. Add 0.25 to the element if the team is playing in home. Since 
    #    home advantage is important in football, the model should reflect 
    #    this fact. Adding 0.25 to the home team will reduce the 'power' 
    #    estimated of this team.
    # 4. Discount older seasons. Games from older seasons should have a 
    #    higher value. Therefore, their contribution to the power 
    #    estimation should be lower than recent seasons.
    # 5. The target variable is points obtained by the first team minus 
    #    points obtained by the second team. Therefore, the range of this 
    #    variables is {-3, 3}. The function points_to_sgn is used to 
    #    transform this variable into a binary one.
    # 6. The model is estimated using a regularized logit. The 
    #    regularization parameter starts at 0.5 and decreases each 
    #    iteration until at least one coefficient is different than zero.
    # 7. Extract the odds ratio of each attribute (team) and normalize it, 
    #    so the range of the power variable is bounded between {0,1}.
